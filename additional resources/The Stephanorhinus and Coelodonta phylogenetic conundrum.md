The *Stephanorhinus* and *Coelodonta* phylogenetic conundrum

The phylogenetic relationship of *Stephanorhinus* and *Coelodonta* has been extensively studied over the last forty years (reviewed in Cappellini et al., 2019). Both morpho-anatomical and molecular data have been used to argue that *Stephanorhinus* represents a paraphyletic group that is closely related to Coelodonta. Mitochondrial genome-based phylogenetic studies (Kirillova et al., 2017; Margaryan et al., 2020) using a single representative per taxon have placed *Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis* as sister to *Coelodonta*, forming a clade with *Dicerorhinus sumatrensis* (Sumatran rhinoceros) as outgroup. Proteome sequencing data derived from an Early Pleistocene dental enamel from a *Stephanorhinus* tooth was used to argue that *Coelodonta* evolved from an early *Stephanorhinus* lineage, and that the *Stephanorhinus* genus is therefore paraphyletic, which was corroborated by Antoine et al â€˜s study that utilised 278 morphological characters (Antoine et al., 2021). However, the close phylogenetic affinities between the *Stephanorhinus-Coelodonta* clade and *Dicerorhinus* recovered by all molecular analyses are at odds with morphology, as analyses of the latter consistently argue that *Stephanorhinus* and/or *Coelodonta* are constantly more closely related to the African rhinoceroses (e.g., Antoine et al., 2021). Thus, the cladogram differences between the morphological and molecular datasets could be attributed to either morphological homoplasy, or long-branch attraction, the latter of which could happen as only limited numbers of genes were analysed, and as many Miocene-Pliocene rhinocerotines cannot be included in molecular trees.
