By conducting pairwise genome alignment between each de novo assembled rhinoceros genome and that of horse (Equus caballus), we did not detect any major within-scaffold segment reshuffling between the rhinoceros species, as well as for that between rhinoceroses and the horse. We then applied Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009) to visualise the genome synteny and collinearity (Figure 1). The good within-scaffold collinearity between rhinoceros species to some extent guarantees the reliability and accuracy of the reference-based analyses for those historic and ancient samples.
